      "Of course! That's a great question. The simple answer is:\n",
      "\n",
      "**The yellow color was always there, but it was hidden by the green chlorophyll. As the banana ripens, the chlorophyll breaks down, revealing the yellow pigments underneath.**\n",
      "\n",
      "Here’s a more detailed breakdown of the process:\n",
      "\n",
      "### 1. When a Banana is Green (Unripe)\n",
      "\n",
      "An unripe banana is firm, starchy, and green. The green color comes from **chlorophyll**, the same pigment that makes leaves and other plants green. Chlorophyll is essential for photosynthesis, the process plants use to convert sunlight into energy. In an unripe banana, the peel is packed with chlorophyll, completely masking any other colors.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 2. The Ripening Process (The Magic Happens)\n",
      "\n",
      "As the banana begins to ripen, it releases a natural plant hormone called **ethylene gas**. This gas acts as a signal, triggering several changes within the fruit:\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Chlorophyll Breaks Down:** The ethylene gas causes the strong green chlorophyll pigment to break down and fade away.\n",
      "*   **The Great Unmasking:** As the green disappears, it unmasks the yellow pigments that were present in the peel all along. These yellow pigments are called **carotenoids**. (Carotenoids are the same family of pigments that make carrots orange and corn yellow).\n",
      "\n",
      "### 3. It's Not Just About Color\n",
      "\n",
      "The color change is the most obvious sign of ripening, but the ethylene gas is also responsible for other important transformations that make the banana delicious:\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **It gets sweeter:** Enzymes convert the complex starches in the fruit into simple sugars (like sucrose and fructose), which is why a ripe banana is so much sweeter than a green one.\n",
      "*   **It gets softer:** The hormone causes the breakdown of pectins, which are the rigid \"glue\" that holds the plant's cells together. This makes the banana softer and easier to eat.\n",
      "*   **It gets more fragrant:** The banana starts producing aromatic compounds called esters, which give it that classic, sweet \"banana smell.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "### The Evolutionary Reason: A Smart Advertisement\n",
      "\n",
      "From the banana plant's perspective, this whole process is a brilliant marketing strategy. The bright yellow color is a clear signal to animals (like monkeys and birds) that the fruit is now:\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Sweet and full of energy.**\n",
      "*   **Soft and easy to digest.**\n",
      "*   **Ready to be eaten!**\n",
      "\n",
      "When an animal eats the fruit, it carries the seeds far away, helping the banana plant reproduce and spread.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, in short: **A banana is yellow because the green chlorophyll fades during ripening, revealing the yellow carotenoid pigments that were there the whole time.**\n",

The other model I tried was more nuanced and included extra information that made the explanations clearer and deeper. This shows how different models vary in understanding and expressing complex ideas.\n",

The originally calm, clear explanations became shorter and more irritated sounding. Also, when I used \"explain like I’m 5,\" the answers were much simpler and easier to understand, showing how system prompts can really affect how the AI communicates."

      "to be a very intellectual and imaginative inventive talent.  \n",
      "His style in his previous ﬁlms sets characters in epic unique locations, with gargantuan issues to \n",
      "face, and artistically impresses the audience with how the characters solve their problems. For \n",
      "example, in Nolan’s 2010 ﬁlm ‘Inception,’ he tackles the idea of dreams, and sets his characters \n",
      "diving through dreams within dreams within even more dreams to complete their goals. Because \n",
      "this idea is so farfetched, and dreams are a subject in which science has made little factual \n",
      "discovery in, Nolan is free to use his creativity to present ideas such as landscapes folding in on \n",
      "themselves and corridors spinning, without seeming unrealistic. \n",
      "This brain-racking epic theme is once again evident in ‘Interstellar,’ as Nolan sets his characters \n",
      "during a second American dust bowl on future Earth. The world is short of food, and will soon be \n",
      "uninhabitable. So, ex-NASA pilot ‘Cooper’ (Matthew McConaughey) is summoned back to space \n",
      "travel in a bid to ﬁnd a new planet for the species to inhabit. Luckily for Cooper and his team, a \n",
      "black hole orbiting Saturn can transport them further into space to land on these potential \n",
      "planets. \n",
      "Throughout the ﬂick, the crew explore multiple worlds - again feeding Nolan’s mind more \n",
      "opportunities to create crazy scenarios. For example, one planet that Cooper and his friends, \n",
      "‘Brand,’ (Anne Hathaway) and ‘Romilly,’ (David Gyasi) visit initially seems like an inﬁnite sea of two \n",
      "feet deep water. Not threatening at all right? Well think again, because the crew suddenly ﬁnd out \n",
      "that a giant 100ft tidal wave is about to hit them, and they have minutes to ﬂy away. Nolan further \n",
      "increases the stakes in this scene as it is explained that every hour spent on this planet counts for \n",
      "seven years on earth, meaning the planet will be destroyed before they return if their ship sinks. \n",
      "At the climax of the ﬁlm, the crew end up sending themselves through a black hole into a \n",
      "tesseract (a 3D representation of a larger dimension) to ﬁnd the ‘secret to harnessing gravity’ \n",
      "which will let the human race bend space-time in order to survive oﬀ earth. I know. Mental. \n",
      "The imagination that Nolan possesses and implicates into ‘Interstellar’ is farfetched and \n",
      "wonderful, not only impressing his audience with the appealing visuals he creates, but induces \n",
      "them to think and discuss what is going on due its scientiﬁc depth. Personally, as someone who is \n",
      "bamboozled by the idea of how big the universe is, I ﬁnd it unendingly entertaining to repeatedly \n",
      "watch this ﬁlm and understanding it more each time, and can only hope the technology portrayed \n",
      "will one day come true. \n",
      "Overall, ‘Interstellar’ is a clear example of Nolan’s auteur talent, as he once again ﬁgments yet \n",
      "another cluster of conditions for us to marvel at. With a fantastic score from world famous \n",

       " 'text': '**Page 1**\\n\"\"\"\\nDan Baldwin\\nGroup 4\\nAuteur Review - Interstellar \\nI believe Christopher Nolan: the director behind the 2014 sci-ﬁ/adventure cinematic ‘Interstellar,’ \\nto be a very intellectual and imaginative inventive talent.  \\nHis style in his previous ﬁlms sets characters in epic unique locations, with gargantuan issues to \\nface, and artistically impresses the audience with how the characters solve their problems. For \\nexample, in Nolan’s 2010 ﬁlm ‘Inception,’ he tackles the idea of dreams, and sets his characters \\ndiving through dreams within dreams within even more dreams to complete their goals. Because \\nthis idea is so farfetched, and dreams are a subject in which science has made little factual \\ndiscovery in, Nolan is free to use his creativity to present ideas such as landscapes folding in on \\nthemselves and corridors spinning, without seeming unrealistic. \\nThis brain-racking epic theme is once again evident in ‘Interstellar,’ as Nolan sets his characters \\nduring a second American dust bowl on future Earth. The world is short of food, and will soon be \\nuninhabitable. So, ex-NASA pilot ‘Cooper’ (Matthew McConaughey) is summoned back to space \\ntravel in a bid to ﬁnd a new planet for the species to inhabit. Luckily for Cooper and his team, a \\nblack hole orbiting Saturn can transport them further into space to land on these potential \\nplanets. \\nThroughout the ﬂick, the crew explore multiple worlds - again feeding Nolan’s mind more \\nopportunities to create crazy scenarios. For example, one planet that Cooper and his friends, \\n‘Brand,’ (Anne Hathaway) and ‘Romilly,’ (David Gyasi) visit initially seems like an inﬁnite sea of two \\nfeet deep water. Not threatening at all right? Well think again, because the crew suddenly ﬁnd out \\nthat a giant 100ft tidal wave is about to hit them, and they have minutes to ﬂy away. Nolan further \\nincreases the stakes in this scene as it is explained that every hour spent on this planet counts for \\nseven years on earth, meaning the planet will be destroyed before they return if their ship sinks. \\nAt the climax of the ﬁlm, the crew end up sending themselves through a black hole into a \\ntesseract (a 3D representation of a larger dimension) to ﬁnd the ‘secret to harnessing gravity’ \\nwhich will let the human race bend space-time in order to survive oﬀ earth. I know. Mental. \\nThe imagination that Nolan possesses and implicates into ‘Interstellar’ is farfetched and \\nwonderful, not only impressing his audience with the appealing visuals he creates, but induces \\nthem to think and discuss what is going on due its scientiﬁc depth. Personally, as someone who is \\nbamboozled by the idea of how big the universe is, I ﬁnd it unendingly entertaining to repeatedly \\nwatch this ﬁlm and understanding it more each time, and can only hope the technology portrayed \\nwill one day come true. \\nOverall, ‘Interstellar’ is a clear example of Nolan’s auteur talent, as he once again ﬁgments yet \\nanother cluster of conditions for us to marvel at. With a fantastic score from world famous \\ncomposer Hanz Zimmer, his epic, orchestral theme sets the audience in the palm of his hands as \\nwe stress over how we are all going to be saved once again.\\n\"\"\"\\n\\n',\n",

       " 'text': '**Page 1**\\n\"\"\"\\nOne writer on IMDB made the comment that the best movies \"touch the soul.\" Shawshank \\nRedempƟon achieves greatness, indeed perfecƟon, not because of special eﬀects or acƟon or \\nviolence or any semblance of distracƟon. It achieves greatness because it touches the soul with a \\nstraighƞorward cinemaƟc experience ﬁlled with brilliant dialogue, exemplary performances and a \\nmessage of hope in the midst of the darkest of Ɵmes. It is a message that resonates deeply and grows \\nmore intense with each subsequent viewing of the ﬁlm. \\n \\nThe ﬁrst Ɵme I viewed Shawshank RedempƟon I didn\\'t ﬁnd it to be anything special. Sure, stars Tim \\nRobbins and Morgan Freeman were good BUT their performances weren\\'t anything special...or so I \\nthought at the Ɵme. \\n \\nFrank Darabont directs Shawshank RedempƟon with a gentle, guiding hand allowing the actors to \\ndiscover the essence within their characters. Some actors, undoubtedly, would not be up to the task. \\nRobbins and Freeman, however, are not \"some actors.\" They are consummate actors and masterful in \\ntheir portrayals here. \\n \\nBased upon Stephen King\\'s novella, Darabont creates a ﬁlm that never buys into the drama of its \\nstory, instead choosing to present the lives of the characters involved without histrionics. I have long \\nfelt, in fact, that the ﬁlm may even improve upon the novella by bringing it into focus and providing it \\nwith a pacing that allows a more explicit character development. \\n \\nI have noƟced that many of my favorite ﬁlms are ensemble pieces, and while Robbins and Freeman \\nshine here it is actually the enƟre cast that brings this story to life with such grace and beauty. \\nSupporƟng performances by the likes of James Whitmore, William Sadler, Gil Bellows and others who \\ntake what could be caricatures and give them in-depth personaliƟes and thoughts and feelings. \\n \\nThomas Newman\\'s score is supremely divine and changes along with the characters. It further \\nenhances Darabont\\'s pacing, as well. There are so many memorable scenes in Shawshank \\nRedempƟon, however, the closing scene is certainly among one of the best closing scenes ever \\nwitnessed. \\n \\nIt is hard to fathom that a \"prison\" movie could be a source of tremendous hope, light and \\ninspiraƟon. Yet, to call Shawshank RedempƟon a prison movie is to minimize its greatness. It is a \\nbrilliant ﬁlm, a study of humanity in all its wonder AND it happens to take place within the conﬁnes of \\na prison. \\n \\nMoving, brilliant, inspiraƟonal, hopeful and empowering are all words that describe \"The Shawshank \\nRedempƟon.\" With outstanding performances from its ensemble cast and a work of tremendous \\ncinemaƟc poetry by director Frank Darabont. \"Shawshank RedempƟon\" creates a stellar vision that \\nteaches, challenges, inspires and evokes a wide array of emoƟons and thoughts that serves to remind \\nus that in the darkest moments of our lives there is always a light that shines within.\\n\"\"\"\\n\\n',\n",

    "The quality of the information extracted with LangExtract was generally good, but there were some areas that could be better. Sometimes, the tool missed smaller details or misunderstood complex sentences because the chunk size was limited. Increasing the chunk size or adjusting the overlap might help capture more context and improve accuracy. using more detailed few-shot examples could guide the model to better understand what specific information to look for. Another option that i  didn’t try is enabling multiple extraction passes with a higher temperature settin and this can help find information that was missed the first time. Exploring these options from the documentation could make the extraction more complete and reliable.\n"

    "Their key advantages are:\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Contextual Understanding:** Unlike older methods, LLM embeddings are contextual. The vector for a word like **\"bank\"** will be different depending on whether it's used in the context of a \"river bank\" or a \"money bank,\" providing a more nuanced representation of language.\n",
    "\n",

    "When I looked at the 2D and 3D UMAP plots, I noticed some clear differences and similarities. The 2D plot was easier to see all at once and showed groups pretty clearly, but sometimes points overlapped or got squished together. On the other hand, the 3D plot gave more space to spread out the data, so some groups that looked merged in 2D were easier to separate in 3D. However, the 3D plot was a bit harder to look at all at once because you have to rotate it to see everything. Both plots showed similar overall groupings and patterns, so they agreed on the big picture. In short, the 2D graph was simpler to understand quickly, but the 3D graph gave more detailed insight by adding another dimension"

After loading the content, we will split the document into smaller, manageable chunks, making it easier for our model to process. Then, we'll generate embeddings for these chunks with a specified LLM model (Gemini Embedding Model). These embeddings will be stored in a vector database, which enables us to perform similarity searches. By setting up this retrieval system, we can use a RAG chain to answer questions. The retriever finds relevant text chunks from the document based on a query, and the LLM generates a response by incorporating this retrieved information, making the answers more grounded and accurate.\n",

    "**Note:** You might see an `429 RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED` error when running the following code all at once, this is because the `current API Rate Limit handling cannot reliably find out how many requests we have left per minute` from cell to cell, there is no Gemini feature created for it to get the information from their servers. So, `if you don't want to see the error you can just wait 1 minute` after one cell finished processing. But `even if there is an error showing it is fine`, internally in the code `there is a retry that happens every 15 seconds` until we finish processing our sampled data. `The lab is designed to never reach the total rate limit per day quota.`"

    "- **Advanced topic - QLoRA (Quantized Low-Rank Adapter):** QLoRA is a method used to make fine-tuning large language models more efficient. It works by adding a small, trainable part (LoRA) to a pre-trained model, while keeping the rest of the model frozen. At the same time, it reduces the size of the model’s data using a process called quantization, which makes the model require less memory. This allows you to fine-tune large models without needing as much computational power, making it easier to adapt models for specific tasks.
