that the best movies \"touch the soul.\" Shawshank \nRedempƟon achieves greatness, indeed perfecƟon, not because of special eﬀects or acƟon or \nviolence or any semblance of distracƟon. It achieves greatness because it touches the soul with a \nstraighƞorward cinemaƟc experience ﬁlled with brilliant dialogue, exemplary performances and a \nmessage of hope in the midst of the darkest of Ɵmes. It is a message that resonates deeply and grows \nmore intense with each subsequent viewing of the ﬁlm. \n \nThe ﬁrst Ɵme I viewed Shawshank RedempƟon I didn't ﬁnd it to be anything special. Sure, stars Tim \nRobbins and Morgan Freeman were good BUT their performances weren't anything special...or so I \nthought at the Ɵme. \n \nFrank Darabont directs Shawshank RedempƟon with a gentle, guiding hand allowing the actors to \ndiscover the essence within their characters. Some actors, undoubtedly, would not be up to the task. \nRobbins and Freeman, however, are not \"some actors.\" They are consummate actors and masterful in \ntheir portrayals here. \n \nBased upon Stephen King's novella, Darabont creates a ﬁlm that never buys into the drama of its \nstory, instead choosing to present the lives of the characters involved without histrionics. I have long \nfelt, in fact, that the ﬁlm may even improve upon the novella by bringing it into focus and providing it \nwith a pacing that allows a more explicit character development. \n \nI have noƟced that many of my favorite ﬁlms are ensemble pieces, and while Robbins and Freeman \nshine here it is actually the enƟre cast that brings this story to life with such grace and beauty. \nSupporƟng performances by the likes of James Whitmore, William Sadler, Gil Bellows and others who \ntake what could be caricatures and give them in-depth personaliƟes and thoughts and feelings. \n \nThomas Newman's score is supremely divine and changes along with the characters. It further \nenhances Darabont's pacing, as well. There are so many memorable scenes in Shawshank \nRedempƟon, however, the closing scene is certainly among one of the best closing scenes ever \nwitnessed. \n \nIt is hard to fathom that a \"prison\" movie could be a source of tremendous hope, light and \ninspiraƟon. Yet, to call Shawshank RedempƟon a prison movie is to minimize its greatness. It is a \nbrilliant ﬁlm, a study of humanity in all its wonder AND it happens to take place within the conﬁnes of \na prison. \n \nMoving, brilliant, inspiraƟonal, hopeful and empowering are all words that describe \"The Shawshank \nRedempƟon.\" With outstanding performances from its ensemble cast and a work of tremendous \ncinemaƟc poetry by director Frank Darabont. \"Shawshank RedempƟon\" creates a stellar vision that \nteaches, challenges, inspires and evokes a wide array of emoƟons and thoughts that serves to remind \nus that in the darkest moments of our lives there is always a light that shines within.\n\"\"\"\n\n", "document_id": "doc_10737029"}
